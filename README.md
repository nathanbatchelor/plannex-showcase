## 📋 API Endpoints

### Core Endpoints
```
Users:
  POST   /api/v1/users              # Create user
  GET    /api/v1/users/{id}         # Get user profile
  POST   /api/v1/users/login        # User authentication

Groups:
  POST   /api/v1/groups             # Create group
  GET    /api/v1/groups/{id}        # Get group details
  POST   /api/v1/groups/{id}/members/{userId}    # Join group
  DELETE /api/v1/groups/{id}/members/{userId}    # Leave group

Events:
  POST   /api/v1/events             # Create event
  GET    /api/v1/events/{id}        # Get event details
  GET    /api/v1/events/groups/{id} # Get group events

Availability:
  PUT    /api/v1/availability/users/{id}         # Update user availability
  DELETE /api/v1/availability/users/{id}         # Clear user availability
```

## 🧪 Current Development Status

**MVP Phase Complete Features:**
- ✅ User authentication and profile management
- ✅ Group creation and member management  
- ✅ Real-time availability calendar
- ✅ Basic event planning and coordination
- ✅ Responsive UI with modern design
- ✅ RESTful API with comprehensive error handling

**Coming in Phase 2:**
- 🔄 Enhanced event planning suite
- 🔄 Spontaneous "ping" events
- 🔄 In-app messaging system
- 🔄 Photo sharing capabilities

## 📊 Key Design Decisions

### Backend Architecture
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with distinct layers
- **DTO Pattern**: Separate public and private user data representations
- **Global Exception Handling**: Consistent error responses across all endpoints
- **JPA Relationships**: Proper entity relationships with cascade operations

### Frontend Architecture
- **Context API**: Centralized state management for user, groups, and availability
- **Component Composition**: Reusable components with clear responsibilities
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage for better development experience
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS

### Data Flow
```
Frontend Components → Context Providers → API Layer → Backend Controllers → Services → Repositories → Database
```

## 🐛 Known Limitations (MVP)

- Authentication is basic (no JWT/OAuth implementation)
- No real-time notifications
- Limited event management features
- Basic error handling on frontend
- No comprehensive testing suite
- PostgreSQL configuration hardcoded

## 📈 Performance Considerations

- **Database Indexes**: Strategic indexing on frequently queried fields
- **Lazy Loading**: JPA lazy loading for entity relationships
- **API Efficiency**: DTOs prevent over-fetching of data
- **Frontend Optimization**: Context providers minimize unnecessary re-renders

### Code Quality
- Comprehensive documentation in code
- Consistent naming conventions
- Separation of concerns
- Error handling throughout the stack
